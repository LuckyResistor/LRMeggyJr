Lucky Resistor's Meggy Jr RGB Driver
========================================================================================

This is a full featured game library for the Meggy Jr RGB hardware. It was written from 
scratch to provide a solid base for game development.

The Features
------------

- Minimal SRAM usage.
- Display double buffering (no flickering).
- Selectable application frame rate (15, 30, 60 or 120 FPS).
- Loop to display synchronization.
- Simple RGB color handling with Color class.
- Advanced functions like scrolling and fading.
- Comfortable button handling.
- Interrupt based sound player, with notes and effects.
- Load meter to graphically measure your loop performance.

The Requirements
----------------

- You will need Arduino version 1.5 or newer. 1.0 will not work.
- You need version 1.3 of Meggy Jr RGB. Older may work, but I could not test it.

Documentation
-------------

All methods in the "LRMeggyJr.h" file are fully documented. See also the provided
examples for details how to use the interface.

I'm currently working on a game using this library and will add additional examples
and documentation later.

Have fun!
